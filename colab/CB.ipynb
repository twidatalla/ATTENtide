        "# **Conformational Biasing! (CB)**\n",

        "This notebook implements a computational pipeline for designing protein variants with altered conformational state preferences, based on contrastive scoring using inverse folding models across alternative structures of a protein. Running this notebook with default inputs will generate predictions for LplA, a protein we engineered for promiscuous and site-specific labeling using CB.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more information, see below:\n",
        "- [*Pre-print: Computational design of conformation-biasing mutations to alter protein functions*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.03.652001v1)\n",
        "- [Github Repository](https://github.com/alicetinglab/ConformationalBiasing)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usage Tracking**: This notebook uses a small counter to track how many users have run it. This helps us understand the reach of the tool and improve on its functionality. The only data recorded is the number of times it has been run - no other data is saved.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview and Inputs\n",
        "The notebook takes two protein structures representing different conformational states of a protein and:\n",
        "1. Aligns the two protein structures/sequences to generate a consensus sequence\n",
        "2. Generates all possible single-point mutations (user can upload additional sequences to score)\n",
        "3. Evaluates variant sequences for biasing effect towards either conformation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input Structure Requirements and Suggestions:**\n",
        "1. Accepted inputs:\n",
        "    - PDB ID (4-letter)\n",
        "    - AlphaFold DB accession\n",
        "    - Custom PDB or mmCIF (uploaded by user)\n",
        "2. Structures should be for the same protein (not orthologs, ideally minimal point mutations)\n",
        "3. Structures should have good and overlapping coverage of the backbone, and similar resolution\n",
        "4. Any uncommon amino acids (e.g. PTR, MSE) will be converted to the closest standard amino acid. Unrecognized amino acids may result in errors/no predictions for that position.\n",
        "5. AlphaFold/predicted structures seem to be acceptable, and can be used to generate a structure in a given conformation by templating on an ortholog in that structure\n",
        "\n",
        "**Other optional inputs:**\n",
        "1. Additional sequences (e.g. double mutants, designed variants of proteins) to be scored, in fasta format\n",
        "2. Reference sequence. The sequence will be automatically extracted from structure files, but in case both files are missing the same region or the user wants to enforce a certain AA numbering. Reference sequence may be augmented after input if it does not totally cover both PDBs (e.g. truncated at the C-terminus)\n",
        "## Models and Code\n",
        "We implement CB with four different inverse folding models:\n",
        "- **ProteinMPNN** (Default): [Reference](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2187), [Code](https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN)\n",
        "- **Frame2Seq**: [Reference](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.15.571823v1), [Code](https://github.com/dakpinaroglu/Frame2seq)\n",
        "- **ThermoMPNN**: [Reference](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2314853121), [Code](https://github.com/Kuhlman-Lab/ThermoMPNN)\n",
        "- **ESM-IF1**: [Reference](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/hsu22a/hsu22a.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm)\n",
        "\n",
        "Pipeline prioritizes running ProteinMPNN, as it is the most extensively validated in our manuscript. Additional models can be run at the user's preference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model codebases were modified slightly in order to ensure compatibility and ease of use. No weights were modified, nor any other functional changes. Running ProteinMPNN is enabled by code from [ColabDesign](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign) (thank you to [solab](https://www.solab.org/)!). Changes to other repositories can be found at the following links: [Frame2Seq](https://github.com/andrewxue98/Frame2seq), [ThermoMPNN](https://github.com/andrewxue98/ThermoMPNN), and [ESM-IF1](https://github.com/andrewxue98/esm)\n",
        "\n",
        "Overlapping predictions between all models seem to be high confidence biasing mutations (see CB manuscript, Figure S11).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Output\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline produces a CSV file containing:\n",
        "- Generated mutations and variant sequences\n",
        "- Scores from each model for both conformational states\n",
        "- Predicted conformational bias classifications for each model\n",
        "\n",
        "## Estimated Runtime\n",
        "Our method is lightweight and can quickly evaluate thousands of point mutations. For saturation mutagenesis, the runtime does scale exponentially for larger proteins, which may require additional considerations. For a protein of size ~38kDa/340 amino acids, model evaluation time for various GPUs is approximately:\n",
        "- **ProteinMPNN**: 3 min *(T4)*, 1 min *(L40)*, 1 min *(A100)*\n",
        "- **Frame2Seq**: &lt;1min *(T4, L40, A100)*\n",
        "- **ThermoMPNN**: &lt;1min *(T4, L40, A100)*\n",
        "- **ESM-IF1**: 1 hour *(T4)*, 30 min *(L40)*, 20 min *(A100)*\n",
        "\n",
        "## Issues, Troubleshooting, and Limitations\n",
        "**Issues:**\n",
        "1. Please first read through the troubleshooting guide below and see if any of those steps are able to resolve your issues.\n",
        "2. If that fails, please open an issue [**here**](https://github.com/alicetinglab/ConformationalBiasing/issues) and include detailed information about the issue you encounter and your inputs.\n",
        "3. For any non-breaking bugs you encounter, please open an issue as well (thanks!).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Troubleshooting:**\n",
        "1. Check if you have these common issues:\n",
        "    - *Uploaded duplicate structures or extremely similar structures:*\n",
        "        - CB scatter plot will show points with almost perfect correlation.\n",
        "        - Please ensure you're uploading two different conformational states of a protein. We see good results even on subtle shifts so if points are almost perfectly correlated, it's likely that the conformational difference captured in the structure is not meaningful.\n",
        "    - *Uploaded structures of different protein:*\n",
        "        - Very poor alignment on alignment chart, almost no mutant sequences generated.\n",
        "        - Please check your structures in the structure viewer below.\n",
        "    - *Uploaded structures of protein orthologs:*\n",
        "        - Poor/spotty alignment on alignment chart, many points in alignment missing, fewer mutant sequences generated\n",
        "        - Upload a structure with a matching sequence (could be AlphaFold generated using original structure as a template)\n",
        "    - *Poor overlap of resolved backbones:*\n",
        "        - Would show as non-overlapping alignments on alignment chart\n",
        "        - Some structures are only solved on part of the backbone. This pipeline only works on regions where the structure is solved in both conformations. Please generate/find structures where the backbone overlap is good.\n",
        "    - *Selected incorrect chains:*\n",
        "        - Possibly poor alignment on alignment chart, fewer mutant sequences generated.\n",
        "        - Please check chains in structure viewer below and make sure you're selecting the correct chain\n",
        "2. Check structure files in pyMOL or similar:\n",
        "    - Ensure chains are not named abnormally\n",
        "    - Check for unnatural amino acids (some are handled by default, but not all)\n",
        "    - Check for missing atoms\n",
        "    - Sometimes [PDBFixer](https://github.com/openmm/pdbfixer) can help resolve these issues\n",
        "\n",
        "**Current Limitations:**\n",
        "- ESM-IF1: runtime is orders of magnitude slower than other models\n",
        "- ThermoMPNN: currently only setup to handle single mutants\n",
        "- This notebook supports single chain scoring only currently\n",
        "- Sensitivity across all variants: we think that our predicted-biased variants have a good hit-rate (see LplA data from manuscript). However, we have not exhaustively characterized false-negatives; it is likely that many mutations we predict as \"neutral\" could have some effect on conformational occupancy.\n",
